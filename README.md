# Tabia Front-end Test

This project is part of the Tabia selection process.

## How to start

After cloning, run npm install to install the project's dependencies and then npm start to start it.
To run the tests, npm test.
The application will run on (http://localhost:3000/).


## About the technologies used

Developed in React with TypeScript, I used the Material-UI library to ensure a modern and responsive interface, as well as Styled Components for more organized styling. With these technologies, I was able to optimize the reading and structure of the code, making the application easier to understand.

## Structure


As soon as you start the project, you'll notice that within src you'll find the folders :

-img : Folder where images originate (profile image).

-Components : These are the components used in the code.

-Pages : This is the main page with a test file.

-Utils : JSON file containing the table information. 

I followed the instructions described at the root of the project (https://github.com/tabiahealth/frontend-challenge?tab=readme-ov-file), thus building the web and mobile pages.
